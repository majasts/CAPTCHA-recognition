# CAPTCHA Recognition Using CNN and Image Processing

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates that CAPTCHA codes can be recognized using digital image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Both **image preprocessing and CNN model training** were implemented in **MATLAB**.

The main challenge was **character segmentation**, addressed with an **adaptive method** that adjusts to each image's characteristics.
